# XINU
XINU stands for Xinu Is Not Unix -- although it shares concepts and even names with Unix, the internal design differs completely. Xinu is a small, elegant operating system that supports dynamic process creation, dynamic memory allocation, network communication, local and remote file systems, a shell, and device-independent I/O functions. The small size makes Xinu suitable for embedded environments.

The objectives of this introductory lab are to familiarize you with the process of compiling and running XINU, the tools involved, and the run-time environment and segment layout.
